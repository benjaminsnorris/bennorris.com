On my way to pick up the middles from Nature School, I stopped at the store. I bought some notebooks for journaling and almost got a new LEGO set, in violation of my self-imposed (and therapist-supported) ban on buying or building new sets.

_These (nearly) [weekly updates](https://bennorris.com/tags/weekly-update/) share life with [OCD](https://bennorris.com/tags/ocd/) as part of my [Mental Work Health](https://bennorris.com/mental-work-health/) project to reduce stigma around mental health, especially at work._

In the line at the register, there was a young girl with braces in front of me, maybe between my oldest daughters’ ages. She put a few things up, and as the prices were scanned, she told the clerk to put back the plastic cups. I asked the clerk to scan those with my stuff and let the girl take them. She paid for the rest with a gift card, but still had almost two dollars balance remaining. She tried to swipe her card, but it declined. I asked if I could pay and reached forward with my phone. She looked a little scared but relieved and grateful and murmured thanks. I said I hoped someone would help out my daughter if she was stuck like that. The older lady behind me in line gave me a big smile and told me I did good.

When the clerk finally scanned my stuff, she looked at the lock on the LEGO castle with a sense of helplessness. She’d clearly never dealt with that before and had no idea what to do. Right then, I noticed I was already late to pick up the kids. I told the clerk to set aside the LEGO set as I had no time.

I laughed as I walked out. God had clearly orchestrated that so that my succumbing to the temptation of another LEGO set was stymied in a way He knew I could not resist—saving a helpless girl who could have been my daughter. I felt grateful that I hadn’t relapsed in buying and building another set. I had other things I needed to do that afternoon, and this indulgence wasn’t what I actually wanted. I’d been saved from myself.
