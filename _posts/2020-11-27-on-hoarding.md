These clips are a fascinating take on hoarding by [Malcolm Gladwell](http://gladwell.com) and [Randy Frost](https://www.smith.edu/academics/faculty/randy-frost).

The first describes perfectly people I know.

The second is a beautiful way to look at it as a gift with a curse. I think that applies just as well to OCD, and nearly all mental illnesses.
