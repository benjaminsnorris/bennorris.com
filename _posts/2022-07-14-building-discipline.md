Lately I have been binging old [Jocko](/tags/jocko/) episodes. I loved his response to this question: “What is a step-by-step guide for building discipline for someone who has little to none of it?”

Even more helpful for me was the answer to a question he posed as a follow-up: “Will the discipline get easier over time?”

> It doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter if it’s easy or hard. You don’t think about it. You don’t consider that. Just do what you are supposed to do.

For someone who often gets stuck in my head about things, this kind of approach is great.

Stop thinking about it, and just do it.
