## Something hard

The job of a stay-at-home mom is hard as hell. Substituting for that job a few days this past week was a good reminder of just how difficult it is. It gave me a renewed appreciation for all that my wife does to help our family and household run smoothly.

And I realize that I only had a small taste of her actual load. Homeschooling seven children is a stressful full-time job in and of itself, and I did almost none of that.

A year ago, I did this same thing, and wrote about it in [update #53: Staying home](https://bennorris.com/2021/09/24/staying-home).

This year, I made things harder for myself by trying to work a bit while also managing the kids. In a shocking surprise, I didn’t get much done. I would have been better off to just focus on spending time with the kids, and then finding some time when I could concentrate on work, instead of trying to straddle both.

As I think about my experience last year and last week, one thing that hits me is that before a couple years ago, this almost never happened. My wife rarely left overnight, and if she did, I usually had instructions written up, like a babysitter.

But now, I’m able to handle this much better. Things don’t go perfectly, and I’m ok with that. This is a marker of progress that is truly meaningful to me. By managing my OCD better, I am able to enable my wife to do more, and that feels great.


## Something good

I have used cold showers before as psychological first aid—usually to help navigate a panic attack. TIP is one of the first skills that I learned from my therapist when I started seeing her during the great breakdown of 2018. It is an acronym for temperature, intense exercise, and paced breathing, and is a gateway skill—it helps allow me to do other skills by breaking the cycle of panic and agitation.

[Jocko](https://bennorris.org/tags/jocko/) talks about taking cold showers, or even ice baths, and how helpful it can be for your physical health. I’m not quite to that point yet.

On Wednesday of last week, I woke up after a good night’s sleep, and started getting ready. At the end of my shower, I turned the water a little colder than I usually do. After a few seconds of shock, it started to feel nice. And when I got out, I was invigorated.

The next day, I started with the water a little colder. I got in, and found that I quickly habituated. I turned it colder, and even that was fine after a few seconds, so I went to turn it even colder and realized that it couldn’t go any further.

So on Friday, I turned the shower to full cold, stepped in, and focused on my breathing. In the past, that kind of shock completely took over my mind, and that’s all I could think of. Now, after just a couple days of doing this, I was just fine after a few seconds. It felt pleasant.

This has so many parallels to my work managing OCD. First off,  the anticipatory experience is almost completely opposite of the lived experience. OCD hijacks my brain, claiming that there is a dire risk (the obsession), and that the only way to avoid calamity is to perform some kind of ritual (the compulsion). In most cases, the fear of what I will feel is much stronger than the fear I actually experience when confronting the risk.

Another huge similarity is the process of habituation. When I went through my IOP (intensive outpatient program) at [The OCD & Anxiety Treatment Center](https://bennorris.org/tags/toatc/), most of the time was spent doing [exposure and response prevention (ERP)](https://bennorris.org/tags/erp/) therapy. That is all about habituating to what my brain claims is an emergency, and sitting with the distress of confronting it.

There is a good chance that cold showers are a phase that will come and go. But for now, I’ll continue to ride it and enjoy the immediate benefits to my mood.


## Something else

Tracking mood

Last week, I shared about meeting with a new psychiatrist and being asked to describe how OCD was manifesting in my life in [update #94: Finding monkeys](https://bennorris.com/2022/08/19/finding-monkeys).

[![Finding monkeys](https://media.bennorris.com/images/mentalworkhealth/posts/finding-monkeys.jpg){:loading="lazy"}](https://bennorris.com/2022/08/19/finding-monkeys){:.clean}

It may have surprised you that I had not been completing my assignment to keep a log of how the days were going. I mentioned that since the follow up appointment, I had been tracking more faithfully.

As I wrote about last week, part of my hesitation was that I didn’t want to open the door to OCD. I realized that this is an opportunity to harness my tendencies for good. Last summer, I wrote about putting [OCD in action](https://bennorris.com/2021/07/15/ocd-in-action). Just like [Monk]() says, “It’s a gift, and a curse.”

The conundrum for me was how much to let myself track.

(Side note: the fact that it was even a conundrum for me is a clear marker that my symptoms are flaring. This kind of “decision” should not merit any substantial thinking.)

I decided that the general rule for myself would be that if I am tracking for a clear purpose, it’s ok. Especially if my doctor asked me to.

If I’m tracking just to have the data, that’s where I should draw the line.

In practical terms, that meant that I deleted the sleep tracking app I had installed that did all sorts of fancy analysis and calculated my sleep debt. (Oh, sweet certainty!) But I kept my mood tracking app and started recording how my days were going.
