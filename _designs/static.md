This served as my main website, including blog and microblog, from the middle of 2016 until the middle of 2018 when I moved to [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog). I hosted the site using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and configured it to support writing and publishing from mobile devices.

I started with an open-source design, and then tweaked everything to have the CSS exactly how I wanted. After a couple years, I found that I spent too much time tweaking the design and wanted to spend more time actually writing.
