As I decided to [go independent as a mobile app consultant](http://localhost:4000/2022/06/23/open-for-business), I made some adjustments to my websites. I moved my primary site to [bennorris.com](https://bennorris.com), and created seperate sites for focused content that would also link back to my main site.

So now I have [authenticcompassion.com](https://authenticcompassion.com), [mentalworkhealth.org](https://mentalworkhealth.org), [sketchnotable.com](https://sketchnotable.com), and [gospelsketcher.org](https://gospelsketcher.org) each as dedicated sites.
