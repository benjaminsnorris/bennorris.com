After a couple years away, I came back to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and consolidated all of my disperate sites into a single site: [bennorris.org](https://bennorris.org). I chose a theme I liked ([Basically Basic](https://github.com/mmistakes/jekyll-theme-basically-basic) by [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com)), and made some tweaks.
