Introduce the basic principles of [Extreme Ownership](https://bennorris.com/tags/extreme-ownership/) and how they apply at O.C. Tanner.

***

This is a presentation I was asked to create to deliver to a group of leaders to share [Extreme Ownership](https://bennorris.com/tags/extreme-ownership/). I had the opportunity to share with larger and larger groups until presenting to all leaders at the company.

One exciting part of this presentation for me was having the opportunity to ask [Jocko](https://bennorris.com/tags/jocko/) and other instructors at [Echelon Front](https://echelonfront.com) for input and advice while preparing.
