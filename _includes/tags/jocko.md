[Jocko Willink](https://jocko.com) is a retired Navy SEAL, and a leadership consultant, podcaster, and author (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jocko_Willink)).

Listening to his books or podcasts is one of my most frequently assigned pieces of homework from my therapist. He has a way of cutting through to the heart of an issue, and speaking the truth that my mind needs to hear. I highly recommend learning more about him.
