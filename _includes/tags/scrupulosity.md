My primary personal flavor of [OCD](https://bennorris.com/tags/ocd/) is [scrupulosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrupulosity). I explain it as perfectionism with the constant threat of eternal damnation.

In practice, scrupulosity looks like having rules for everything, and feeling intense distress if they are not followed. Many decisions or actions are over-moralized, and there is a “right” way that things must be done.
