[General Conference](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/learn/general-conference?lang=eng) is a biannual conference for members of [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/ComeuntoChrist). The first weekend in April and October, we gather to hear messages about Jesus Christ and living His Gospel.

As often as I can, I capture sketchnotes of the conference talks and share them here.
