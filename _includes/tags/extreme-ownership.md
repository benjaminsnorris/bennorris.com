Extreme Ownership is the name of a [book on leadership and life](https://echelonfront.com/extreme-ownership/) written by [Jocko Willink](/tags/jocko/) and Leif Babin.

It lays out an approach to leadership based on the fact that we are all leaders, and that everything is ultimately the leaderâ€™s responsibility. The core is the four Laws of Combat:

1. Cover and Move
2. Simple
3. Prioritize and Execute
4. Decentralized Command

I have found this framework to be transformational in dealing with my [OCD](/tags/ocd/), and also the answer to the challenges I face as a people leader and as a father.
