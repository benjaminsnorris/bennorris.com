The central focus of my life right now is my family. I am a husband and father of seven—ages 6 to 20.

Professionally, I am Chief of Staff at [SchoolAI](https://schoolai.com). We help make school awesome for students, and the people who support them, by finding out what they need and making it happen.

Life has been so busy lately that I haven’t been able to write as much as I want, but hope to get back to it more soon.

I would love to connect with you: {% include icon-email.html email=site.email %} or {% include icon-linkedin.html username=site.linkedin_username label='LinkedIn' %}.
