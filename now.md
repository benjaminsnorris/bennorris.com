The most important thing I’m doing right now is continuing to recover from and deal with my OCD. I am working to strike the right balance between my personal, family, professional, and spiritual lives. I write about mental health and my journey in [Mental Work Health](/mental-work-health/).

Professionally, I am an independent mobile app consultant. You can learn more and reach out to hire me at [BSN Design](https://bsn.design).

One of my biggest hobbies is sketchnoting, and I post business sketchnotes in [Sketchnotable](/sketchnotable/) and religious sketchnotes in [Gospel Sketcher](/gospel-sketcher/).
