The central focus of my life right now is my family. I am a husband and father of seven—ages 4 to 18.

My biggest passion currently is [Extreme Ownership](https://bennorris.com/tags/extreme-ownership/). I found my way to this approach through a prescription from my therapist to deal with my [OCD](https://bennorris.com/tags/ocd/), and strive to live the principles at work and home.

Professionally, I am a people leader at [O.C. Tanner](https://www.octanner.com), where I lead three teams of software engineers in helping companies celebrate career anniversaries for their people.

You can find books, podcasts, movies, shows, and other creative inputs I consume at [micro.bennorris.com](/micro/){:target="_blank"}.
